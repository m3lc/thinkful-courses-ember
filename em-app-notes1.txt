1. Create initial simple project structure, no ember-cli.
2. Create application; nothing is shown.
3. Create app template; the template is shown.
4. Add outlet.
5. Create the index template; the index template is shown at the outlet.
6. Mention the implicit creation of index for every route.

- implicit creation of routes and binding with templates
10m

7. Plan to create a sidebar as a menu and main content for the application.
8. Create a static menu inside the application template (.list-group , .list-group-item).
9. Add routes in App.Router, mention the deprecation of resources (use this.route('top-level-route', {resetNamespace: true});).
10. Replace the static menu with a template and use named outlets by overriding the ApplicationRoute.
11. Comment out the ApplicationRoute and use the render hbs helper.
12. Comment out the render helper and user the partial hbs helper.
13. Partial is reusable but component can be backed up with its generic component class. Comment out the partial helper and use a component. Create tmpl and use it.
14. Make the menu dynamic by creating model function in ApplicationRoute.
15. Modify component to accept the model as parameter.

- common hbs helpers and component with implicit creation of class, model in routers to supply the template with data

14. Replace the model with a deferred promise, that takes a while.
15. Modify template to show caption "loading....", a spinner could have been used. Needs to populate model in setupController and modify template.
- model of routes uses promises, loading event fired on the closest route, if don't want to block can move logic elsewhere in the flow i.e. setupController
